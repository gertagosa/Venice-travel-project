        <h2>Why Venice?</h2>
        <h1>The Floating City</h1>
        <p>
      Venice, known also as the “City of Canals,” “The Floating City,” and “Serenissima,” 
      is arguably one of Italy's most picturesque cities. With its winding canals, 
      striking architecture, and beautiful bridges, Venice is a popular destination for travel.
       Italy's famous floating city  built on over 100 islands  is a sight to behold. 
        </p>
        <p>
       There are no roads, only canals and labyrinthine streets, linking 
       St Mark's Basilica with quaint coffee shops and hidden art galleries.
      The heart of Venice is Piazza San Marco with its magnificent church, Saint Mark's Basilica.
